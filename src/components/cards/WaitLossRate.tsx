        This is your potential, what your body could lose if it's in fat-burning
        mode. But that depends on getting your metabolism working with you, not
        against you
        <br />
        Low energy, stubborn cravings, and slow progress usually mean your body
        is still burning sugar instead of fat â€” and that keeps weight loss stuck

          With your numbers, results could show up even faster than expected,
          but only if your metabolism is dialed in and you're burning fat, not
